# My Attempt At Learning PyGame
At first I wanted to learn PyGame as a way to simulate the movement of particles within a simulation space; however as I became more immersed in the library I soon realized that I was more interested in learning its every intricacy.

As follows is my exploratory journey into the wonderful library that is PyGame & Game development.

I hope you find something interesting!

Best,
Ren
