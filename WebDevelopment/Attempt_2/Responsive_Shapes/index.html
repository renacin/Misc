            <p>
                &emsp; Ever since I was exposed to programming in my post secondary education, I've tried to include it in every
                personal, or professional project that I've worked on.

                Since my intial exposure I've been able to develop my skills, and work on some cool projects. This blog
                is my attempt at sharing some of the things I've learnt as well as the projects that i've worked on. <br><br>

                Hope you enjoy! <br><br>

                Best, <br>
                Ren M.
